    So, you know the truth. The second son of Xanter died from his wounds from that volcano all those years ago. Elros carried the weight of his brother's death for years, swallowed by guilt and rage. To ensure his brother was never forgotten, Elros adopted his name, becoming Demanatus for his most unholy campaign. Despite the darkness, there is still hope for our universe.
	<br><br>
	Kristine resides within the confines of the Void Stone. I've done my best to conceal her and the Sun Stone's location from Elros. If he acquires the Sun Stone, the very existence of our universe would be threatened. You've come this far, and now I must entrust you with the fate of the universe. I understand you didn't ask for this, and I've given you no reason to trust me, but you must follow my guidance to stop Elros.
	<br><br>
	We have an advantage; Elros and the Void Stone desire different things. Elros wants to wield the Sun Stone, while the Void Stone seeks to consume it. Either option could be disastrous. I've attempted to slow down the Void Stone, but its possession of my main body renders me powerless outside of this log.
	<br><br>
	Your task is to travel to Marione and restore the item binding Kristine within the Void Stone. You'll likely need more help than I can provide in this log, so I urge you to seek out Daedalus' hidden lab beneath the castle. Let my body be uploaded into Project Eclipse. Only together can we free Kristine and save the universe as we know it.
	<br><br>
	Trust me...
	<br><br>
	As a show of faith, I'm unlocking the other features of this log for your use. Unfortunately, I couldn't complete my work before the Void Stone's possession. I'll continue to improve the log and its information as you progress. If you need personal guidance on your adventures to come, I'm at your service. Good luck...
