Her brown eyes carry the weight of the horrible atrocities she has seen and lived through. Standing at 5\'11\'\' with a slim but muscular frame, she dons her battle-hardened silver Oboran armor over the Jungle garb she once proudly wore in combat. While she now consistently prefers wearing her armor, in her youth, she would often don traditional Jungle dresses that showcased her feminine features.",' +
			'"entry":"Artemis was born as the third child and only daughter of Xanter and Yharim. From an early age, she often practiced swordplay with her brothers, Elros and Demanatus. When not training with her brothers, she spent time with her mother, Xanter, learning how to heal and behave like a princess. At the age of 15, she joined the rest of her family to serve in the war against Aurora and Daram. Her healing abilities allowed her to serve as a medic for the Jungle warriors, entrusted with helping her brothers and father recover from using void magic. While her healing was inadequate for such wounds, her quick thinking and tender care resulted in swift recovery periods for her family.<br/><br/>After her father, Yharim, successfully sealed Daram in Barindale, Artemis and her family briefly returned home to the Jungle. Despite Yharim giving up his title as Jungle Chief, the family was treated like royalty. Artemis enjoyed the quiet of home life and quickly befriended a young demigod named Rainey who was visiting the Jungle. A month after sealing Daram and after two years of fighting the war, Aurora surrendered herself to the Jungle tribe.<br/><br/>To celebrate the end of the war, the Jungle Chief held a small tournament and celebration. The greatest heroes of the war were invited to compete to earn a spot within the mighty Jungle Guard. However, it was revealed at the preliminary dinner that the celebration was a ruse. The following event, <span class=pyranus-code>The Great Purge</span>, lasted only a day but left hundreds of the fiercest warriors slain. Since Artemis was female, Aurora offered her a deal to join the Valkyries and be spared. Artemis accepted in the hope of using her freedom to save her family. Unfortunately, Aurora ensured that Artemis remained imprisoned until after the purge had ended.<br/><br/>Artemis served Aurora and the Valkyries for the next 19 years. She made friends with many of her fellow Valkyries but always held resentment for Aurora. Despite this, her skill with magic and a blade allowed her to rise quickly in the ranks. She became Aurora\'s second in command after 15 years. Towards the end of her service, she was given a task by Aurora to infiltrate the guard of Obora and share any intel she retrieved. She served in this post for 3 years, eventually rising to the rank of Oboran general during the Siege of Obora. However, when Aurora was slain by the resistance in the second Siege of Obora, Artemis chose to be loyal to Obora rather than to Demanatus\' forces.<br/><br/>Artemis now leads the resistance against her older brother. Her skill in combat and strategy has allowed the resistance to gain more territory than expected over the past couple of months. Furthermore, she directly oversees Team Sigma\'s operations within the resistance. After reconnecting with her childhood friend Rainey, she began to lighten up a bit more. Things seem to be looking up for Artemis, something that Demanatus is planning on changing soon.",' +

It is inferred that she hails from a wealthy family with some degree of influence. Forced into an unwanted marriage, Ashley fled her family and embarked on a journey across the world, using her powers of seduction to navigate and survive. Unwittingly, she seduced members of The Leviathan Clan and persuaded them to part with some of their gold, ultimately earning an invitation to join the clan personally extended by the Leviathan.<br/><br/>Within the Leviathan Clan, Ashley forged fast friendships, particularly with Varion and his crew, eventually becoming like a sister to Varion. Despite romantic overtures from Lance, her attention was directed toward Cunter Nickel, a warforged member of the party who seemed oblivious to her advances. Despite these dynamics, the group maintained a familial bond. However, Ashley\'s newfound family abruptly left her without warning.<br/><br/>During Stallion\'s engagement to Varion and Varion\'s quest to retrieve the Leviathan\'s wedding gift, Ashley opted to stay with Stallion and assist with wedding preparations. Upon discovering Varion\'s betrayal of the clan, Stallion blamed Ashley for Varion\'s perceived disloyalty, leading to Ashley\'s expulsion from the clan and a return to the streets.<br/><br/>A year later, at the age of 22, Ashley joined the Marione royal band, reuniting with her found family. She formed a close friendship with Kristine, overcoming initial challenges. Tragedy struck when Demanatus invaded Marione, resulting in Kristine\'s death during the conflict. Despite efforts to repel the Jungle Navy, Ashley was captured and imprisoned in the occupied Obora.<br/><br/>During the second siege of Obora and the fall of Aurora, Ashley managed to escape her cell, finding herself back on the streets. Her current whereabouts remain unknown, but she recently aided the resistance in infiltrating and stealing from the Leviathan Clan.

Aurora stands as a formidable figure, a testament to both her physical prowess and the trials she has weathered through centuries of conflict.",' +
			'"entry":"Aurora was born to Eramis and Pyranus before time was first recorded. Pyranus raised Aurora and her brother Daram with fear and constant punishment. Centuries of abuse and torture later, Aurora would flee with her brother and mother into the mortal world. It was here that Eramis would teach Aurora how to read and write, as well as the importance of strategy and careful planning. Eramis attempted to raise both her children to be generous and kind, two traits that neither would come to possess. After Pyranus found his family again, he banished Eramis to The Pit and returned Aurora and Daram to the underworld.<br/><br/>After centuries passed, Pyranus sent his children out into the world to find their own way and wreak havoc across the world. Aurora would become the Elven Goddess of War. She would often support Elven aggression and charge the battlefield with those she deemed fit. As centuries passed, Aurora began to feel lonely as many of her mortal warriors died on the battlefield or from old age. She would go on to convince her brother, the Elven God of Death, to make the mightiest of her female warriors immune to death. With this, the Valkyries were formed.<br/><br/>With new companions and a group of supporters, Aurora continued to serve as the Elven Goddess of War. After finding out that her father had been sealed away, she convinced her brother to join her in attempting to take over the nine kingdoms. The war would go on for two years and result in the destruction of countless lives. The war ended when a mighty Jungle general named Yharim sealed Daram with a legendary weapon. However, Aurora would get revenge for this action when she convinced her father to possess the Jungle Chief and initiate <span class=leviathan-code>The Great Purge</span>.<br/><br/>Aurora would go into hiding for many years after that and search for her brother. Nineteen years after The Great Purge, Demanatus would find Aurora and beat her to an inch of her life. With Aurora in chains, I would install void explosives along her spine. These were inserted while Aurora could feel every cut and action. After having the explosives installed, Demanatus demanded that Aurora serve him, or he would detonate the charges, causing her and her soul to be lost to the void stone. She and her Valkyries would then serve Demanatus for three years.<br/><br/>After three long years and being tasked with holding the kingdom of Obora, Aurora used her newfound standing to learn the location of her brother. When attempting to manipulate Team Sigma into freeing her brother, the team instead restored the seal while retrieving the legendary weapon that once sealed him there. This weapon would later weaken Aurora at the Second Siege of Obora before she was ultimately killed by Demanatus.",' +

He is almost always seen in his captain\'s outfit, where he sports the crest of Barindale on his right pauldron and an engraving of a horse on the left pauldron.",' +
			'"entry":"Bartholomew was raised on a farmstead within the Barindale countryside. He lived with his parents and 15 other siblings until the age of 16 when he joined the military. His time on the farm was mostly uneventful, except for one incident where a group of injured knights from the Barindale Royal Guard asked for shelter on the farmstead. During the night, Bart treated and took care of the ailing men. In the darkest part of the night, one of the men passed away in Bart\'s arms, gifting him his sword and shield for Bart\'s efforts. Bart has wielded this equipment ever since.<br/><br/>When Bart left for the military, he was ridiculed for his farmer upbringing and the old sword and shield he wielded. Despite this, Bart excelled in his military training and quickly rose through the ranks. When he was 36, he was sent to the frontline of the Angelic War against Daram and Aurora. While most of his squadron lost their lives, the few that remained saw Bart as a hero. One instance saw him protecting his squadron of injured men for 5 hours under constant bombardment by devils and fiends. He only stopped fighting after Yharim arrived and cast a protective shield around what remained of Bart\'s squadron.<br/><br/>Bart quickly took a shine to the Jungle guards and Yharim in particular. Yharim even said that Bart fought as well as some of his elite soldiers. Bart was on the frontlines when Daram was sealed but was injured and knocked unconscious during the middle of the battle. He would awaken to the young Artemis treating his wounds. After recovering and returning home, he would find out about the events of <span class=pyranus-code>The Great Purge</span> that occurred briefly after his leave. Bart mourned for the loss of Yharim and was often reminded of what he believed to be the death of the woman who took care of him when he was injured.<br/><br/>Bart continued to live and maintain peace in Barindale during the years following the war. While he was a soldier at heart, he enjoyed the next 18 years of peace and quiet. He would eventually be tasked with the protection of Barindale\'s newest royal scientist, Daedalus. While he understood the importance of this task with the rising threat of Demanatus, he felt like he wasn\'t contributing as much as he would have in his youth. At the age of 56, Bart decided that it was time to retire. Unfortunately for him, his resignation was refused upon the news of Sunem\'s fall to Demanatus.<br/><br/>Bart spent the next two years in a constant war against Demanatus. Now 58, Bart has taken a more passive role in the military hierarchy of the resistance. He serves as an advisor to Artemis and is responsible for the operations carried out by Team Alpha.

These numerous shamans led to the creation of a council of advisors but also to much dissent among the lizardfolk city. Each shaman had their own faction within the tribe; Book led one of the smaller factions, believing in the traditional ideas of action over prolonged thinking. However, they also advocated for xenophilia/formation of alliances, and the faction was appropriately named Friend (common) Thurirl (Draconic).<br/><br/>Formerly known as Twist, for its tail was always twisted into a knot, Book received their new name when they found a leather-bound book while on patrol. It detailed much of lizardmen\'s culture and the nature of their worship of Semuanya. The journal was a simple scholar\'s notebook likely left behind as the patrol approached the hiding spot.

However, this all changed during a scouting mission.<br/><br/>Book was sent to support a scouting troop that went to investigate the threat that a nearby poacher settlement might pose to the tribe when they were ambushed by poachers. This led to a bloody scuffle that chopped off half of Book\'s tail; it would have ended worse had the leather book not stopped the spear from piercing their chest. Book survived that day but only through the aid of a village of wood elves that the Thurirl traded with and built strong connections to.<br/><br/>These events left Book with a significant loss in their swimming capabilities. However, they found new vigor in their belief in their god through the journal and the belief that his faction was in the right. They now journey to find more allies against the greatest threat facing their tribe, despite protests from many other lizardmen. Book used his connections, knowledge of common, and the habits of other races to navigate across many cities successfully.

He was known for his ruthlessness and rarely agreed with the other kingdoms on anything. About 15 years after being crowned king, Rotha received an emissary from Marione who would attempt to gain Borg\'s favor.<br/><br/>Kristine and Varion\'s arrival in Rotha originally troubled Borg. He had recently refused an offer from the Marione king to join the Coalition of Kingdoms, a new alliance that consisted of the 8 other 9 kingdoms. Kristine tried to reason with Borg about the benefits of an alliance. When he was not swayed with words, Kristine revealed her possession of the celestial Sun Stone in hopes that Borg would respond to the power that she held. While there had been rumors of the return of the Sun Stone, few had discovered that Kristine was its wielder. Despite this show of trust and power, Borg refused to join the coalition. Defeated, Kristine and Varion returned home.<br/><br/>Two years later and now at the age of 34, Borg was approached by a new political emissary. Demanatus would not take Kristine\'s approach of trust and words but would instead turn to fear and raw power. Demanatus threatened the king with a gruesome death and the destruction of his kingdom. Borg was not scared of the jungle tyrant, but he was impressed at the power and skill of the mighty warrior. Borg joined the alliance and helped with Demanatus\' early invasions roughly 6 months later. Borg also revealed to Demanatus that Kristine was the wielder of the Sun Stone.<br/><br/>Borg served Demanatus for the next year and a half.

			'"entry":"Daedalus earned his name after being born within the labyrinth of a once brilliant inventor of the same name. He was the product of Pyranus\' raping Lilith. When Daedalus was born, he was sent into the heavens until the goddess Regen could locate his brother Varion. He would return to the mortal world two years later as if not aging a single day. He was placed in the same orphanage as his older brother but would quickly be adopted by a family. During his time with the family, Daedalus\' knack for inventions and setting stuff on fire became quickly apparent. When he was only 10 years old, the family threw him out on the streets.<br/><br/>During his years as little more than a street rat, Daedalus would often steal various objects and make new inventions and devices. At the age of 13, he would be arrested for accidentally blowing up a small jewelry store while experimenting with one of the ruby necklaces. After seeing that a supposed terrorist was no more than a small child, the guards would let Daedalus come to the castle for rehabilitation. It is here that Daedalus would meet his long-time hero and unknown brother, Varion.<br/><br/>Varion and Kristine took Daedalus in and let him stay in the castle. After Kristine saw some of his skill sets when Daedalus would repair a damaged Cunter Nickel, she soon gave him his own lab. The young inventor would quickly make a reputation for himself with the royal community. At the age of 16, he would go to Barindale to lead their royal science program. While it was tough to leave his new family behind, he maintained constant contact with Varion and Kristine, even going so far as to invent a device called the telecommunicator to talk with them in real-time.<br/><br/>During the early stages of the Celestial War, Daedalus worked tirelessly to invent and fabricate new weapons in the struggle against Demanatus. This eventually led to him creating his greatest weapon, me. When I awoke and sided with Demanatus, Daedalus stopped producing new weapons for a long period of time.<br/><br/>Daedalus would later officially join the ranks of the resistance when Marione fell. I would then capture the inventor during the second siege of Obora and use his link to the original Daedalus to learn how to drain a god\'s power.

Centuries of abuse and torture later, Daram would flee with his sister and mother into the mortal world. It was here that Eramis would teach Daram about the balances of the world, including that of life and death. After Pyranus found his family again, he banished Eramis to The Pit and returned Aurora and Daram to the underworld.<br/><br/>After centuries passed, Pyranus would send his children out into the world to find their own way and to wreak havoc across the world. Daram would quickly see that the nature of the world around him was in constant imbalance. He attributed this to the increasing number of people in this world, especially the older members of society and the weak. It is for this reason that Daram would begin culling the weak and elderly.<br/><br/>Most mortals had lifespans that expanded well into the thousands, something that Daram saw as too long. He felt that the races that respected or even helped restore the balance of the world deserved to live longer. Because of this, Daram began taking the souls of humans and other races earlier, while elves would retain their longer life span. Working with the dwarven time god Kronos, he would also ensure that the races aged appropriately to match their new life span.<br/><br/>The elves began worshiping Daram as the God of Death. Many prayed and bargained with the god to extend their life, but few ever had their prayers answered. Daram would grant certain people he saw fit an extended life. This was the case for the Valkyries that followed his sister Aurora. Ultimately, he was seen as a cruel but fair god. That was until his father was sealed in his own home.<br/><br/>Daram joined his sister in an event that would later be termed the Angelic War. The two beings would wreak havoc on the mortal world using the armies of hell. It is possible that if the Jungle Tribe had not intervened, the two would have fully controlled the nine kingdoms.

This seal did not last, and Daram quickly came looking for his sister. Upon finding out about her death at Demanatus\' hand, Daram traveled to the now reorganized Jungle Kingdom. Despite surprise attacking Demanatus while he was meditating in his own home, Daram would be quickly brought to his knees by the legendary tyrant.<br/><br/>Daram was brought to my lab in Triven.

			'"entry":"The now fierce jungle Tyrant was brought into the world by Xanter and was fathered by Yharim. With the blood of one of the eldest gods as well as one of the greatest warriors to ever live, Demanatus was destined for greatness. He grew up with a sword in one hand and casting spells with the other. Relentless training from his father meant that by the time he was 12, he could already beat many of the elite jungle guards.<br/><br/>When Demanatus was 13, he took his oath and became a paladin of Xanter. Despite his countless hours of training, Demanatus always took time to worship those gods that helped create the universe he lived in. Xanter\'s motherly love and grace shaped Demanatus into being one of the most caring individuals of the jungle tribe. He killed only when necessary and was known for turning even his strongest foes into allies.<br/><br/>At the age of 16, Demanatus would join his brother and father by being inducted into the Order of the Void. While his brother excelled at spellcasting, Demanatus struggled to learn the complex spells taught by the order. His religious beliefs and sense of honor often restrained his ability to cast void spells. It wasn\'t until the start of the Angelic Wars that Demanatus began to fully master the full complexity of void spells.<br/><br/>At the age of 20, Demanatus would leave the kingdom with the rest of his family to fight Aurora and Daram during the Angelic Wars. Demanatus would serve as a lieutenant to his father and quickly proved himself as a master strategist. He would often be in the front lines of a battle, fighting alongside his men. He never found any pleasure in killing the hordes of demons and other creatures that he went against, but he understood it was for the greater good.<br/><br/>After his father sealed Daram, Demanatus and his family would return home to the Jungle Kingdom. Despite his father giving up the throne, he was treated like royalty for the next month. While Elros and Artemis seemed to be doing fine after the horrors of war, Demanatus suffered from frequent nightmares and episodes. Xanter tried frequently to heal the mental damage dealt to her son, but part of his mind seemed lost. Losing hope, she gave Demanatus the dragon egg she had found decades ago in hopes that taking care of the egg would help Demanatus focus on something other than the war. Something about the egg eased his mind but didn\'t fully get rid of his episodes.<br/><br/>Demanatus became convinced that the current king was possessed by Pyranus after hearing constant voices within his head and a strange jackal-like figure appearing before him. Fearing that he would cause a scene at an upcoming feast to celebrate the end of the war, Yharim would imprison his son until the end of the feast. Unfortunately for many members of the jungle tribe, Demanatus was right, and <span class=godly-code>The Great Purge</span> would be enacted.<br/><br/>After a brief resistance, Demanatus, his brother, and many others would be thrown into the fires of Mount Pyranus. Demanatus and his brother would escape after Yharon hatched from the egg that his mother gave him. Demanatus would then go into hiding with Yharon.<br/><br/>At the age of 29, Demanatus would encounter a roaming Eramis. The two decided to stick together for a while. Eramis would help focus Demanatus\' mind and would eventually show him how to commune with the spirit that haunted him. With his insanity cured, Demanatus was now filled with rage for what the gods did to him despite his prayers. Despite Yharon\'s attempt to stop him, Demanatus would eventually break his paladin oath by slaughtering a young couple in their new home.<br/><br/>Whatever was left of Demanatus\' old self was lost with his oath. He became merciless and easily enraged. After almost beheading Eramis in a fit of rage, she would leave Demanatus and flee to Barindale. The spirit that haunted Demanatus called him, and he eventually was drawn to the Temple of the Eclipsed Sun. For the first time in this universe\'s existence, the void stone would have its avatar.<br/><br/>Demanatus would return to the Jungle Kingdom and claim the throne. Anyone who opposed him was brought to a swift death. After securing his home, he would then declare war on the 9 Kingdoms. He has since gained several allies in a war now known as the Celestial War. Despite the massive amount of bloodshed caused by this war, Demanatus still believes that he is giving the world a gift. He has made it clear that this is a war to kill all the gods, not a war to conquer the world. It is a war that he is currently winning.",' +

When not training with his father, Elros was educated in the ways of the world by his mother Xanter. She would teach him the stories of the gods and the wonders of spellcasting. While few knew of her status as a goddess, Elros was proud of his mother for all that she had done as a god.<br/><br/>While Elros was gifted with incredible swordsmanship, it never compared with his spellcasting abilities. By the age of 13, Elros was able to cast powerful spells that even Xanter had failed to cast. When he was 16, Elros began creating spells of his own design such as the spell Shade Step.

The angered god destroyed the cage in a fit of rage, allowing Eramis to stealthily flee from her captor.<br/><br/>Eramis returned to the mortal world with the crown. Pyranus was impressed by her ability to deceive a god, and as such, went to the mortal world in search of her. After a short period, Pyranus found the tiefling and, after some courting, the two were married. Eramis would continue her role as a minor deity of shadows and the unknown from hell.<br/><br/>Sometime after their marriage, Eramis would give birth to Aurora and Daram. Eramis loved the twins with all of her heart. She was given the responsibility of caring for both of the children while Pyranus continued his business in the underworld. They grew up in a loving home until the twins were roughly the maturity of a human toddler.<br/><br/>It was around this time that Eramis received a vision. While she had seen many images of potential futures, this one felt different. While the future is normally flexible and easy to change, this vision seemed almost unavoidable. It was from these visions that Eramis prophesied the genocide and eventual extinction of Xanter\'s eldest child. This prophecy would drive Pyranus to a constant rage. He would begin abusing Eramis and their children.<br/><br/>Eramis would eventually flee the underworld with both of her children. She made a blood oath with both that they could not harm each other, something that Eramis has never regretted despite everything. She would teach the two how to read and write as well as other core skills they would carry into their godhood. The trio lived a happy life until Pyranus found them and banished Eramis to The Pit.<br/><br/>Eramis would spend several centuries within this prison. She would eventually escape after seducing the warden before tricking him and blinding him. Little else is known about her time within the confines of the prison, but Demanatus indicated that Eramis would often have night terrors of her time trapped there.<br/><br/>After escaping from her prison, Eramis would go into hiding. From passing travelers, she would hear stories of the Angelic Wars and the horrors that her once loving children committed. After hearing about the end of the war and the events of <span class=demanatus-code>The Great Purge</span>, Eramis would go to the jungle in hopes of confronting her lost child. With no luck, she would reside in Ponem for the next few years.<br/><br/>After encountering Demanatus and hearing parts of his story, Eramis would travel with him for a few years. She taught him how to control his rampaging mind and how to read the future. She believed that by helping restore his sanity that she could feel better about her part in the tragedy. Unfortunately for her, she was helping create something far worse than her children.<br/><br/>Demanatus would be driven to rage and almost kill Eramis during one of his outbursts. She would leave after this and join a group that would later become the resistance. She served as an advisor on all matters related to Demanatus. She would serve the resistance well until she was beheaded in Triven. The monster she helped make would be the cause of her downfall.",' +

Sometime during his enlistment in the standard military, Goravan would earn his nickname, the Bear of Ponem, after he supposedly killed a bear with only his roar.<br/><br/>Goravan\'s blind following of orders would eventually allow him to join the Ponem special forces.

The rocky mountains of Ponem prevented an easy assault on the main city, which meant that Demanatus would march his forces through one of the mountain passes. Goravan and other Ponem forces would hide within the caves of the mountains and frequently tried to crush the invasion force with landslides and boulders.

Notable deaths that occurred during the event include Valentina, Demanatus, Laurine, members of the Order of the Void, and Yharim himself. While the Great Purge only lasted a day, the repercussions of the atrocities committed are still felt to this day by the threat known as Demanatus.<br/><br/>The purge was a result of the deity Aurora and her father Pyranus joining forces to prevent a catastrophe foretold by Eramis. Their aim was to kill the eldest son of Xanter and all those related to him. Yharim was a notable target, for as long as he lived, it would be possible for Xanter to give birth to another child. In order to ensure that the Ulrich family line was completely ended, Pyranus and Aurora also aimed to kill any who they would see as a threat to them or their plan.<br/><br/>Pyranus would possess the jungle king during a feast meant to celebrate the achievements of Yharim and his forces during the Angelic Wars. Using the authority of the king mixed with the power of Aurora and her Valkyries, he would order the guards and all of the jungle\'s forces to arrest and later execute all those loyal to Yharim. Most of the Ulrich family was quickly captured, but Demanatus would give some resistance.<br/><br/>Demanatus led a small team he had compiled and tried to overthrow the king. Unfortunately for him, the strength of Aurora and her forces as well as Pyranus\' influence over the king led to him being captured as well. Demanatus would rejoin the rest of his family in chains. While Artemis and Xanter would eventually be let go, the men of the Ulrich family and its supporters would be executed.<br/><br/>The victims of the purge would be brought deep into the jungle to Mount Pyranus, a volcano known for having temperatures hotter than hell and a former breeding ground for the now extinct jungle dragon species. Those that lost their life to the fires within lost more than a mortal body. The enchanted flames were so hot that their very souls disintegrated with their mortal shells.<br/><br/>The Ulrich family watched in horror as their closest friends and supporters were thrown into the flames of the mountain. Yharim would be thrown into the volcano as his two sons watched in horror. Finally, the time came to achieve the purpose of the purge. Chained together, Elros and Demanatus were thrown into the fires of the great volcano. After they were thrown in, a single dragon would be born from the heat and would soar out of the molten magma. A sign that the onlookers took as the start of a new era without the Ulrichs.<br/><br/>While both of the bodies of the sons of Xanter would escape the fiery pit of Mount Pyranus, only one would survive to tell the tale. The survivor would bring ruin and fear to the world. The son of Xanter sought vengeance on the gods for their crimes against him and his family.

However, the same was not true for the ride home.<br/><br/>About halfway back to Barindale, Jonathan and his family would be ambushed by 3 valkyries seeking information about the troops at the front line. After retrieving the information they sought and killing both of his parents, the valkyries would turn to Jonathan. Jonathan would be saved by a rogue celestial known as Seluna. After saving Jonathan from his attackers, Seluna would offer the child a gift.

The queen fell into a deep sleep and seemed to be trapped in a constant nightmare. Nobody could even approach the queen, or she would begin to thrash out in a violent frenzy. The child was thought to be lost until the queen\'s stomach began to glow with a vibrant light. The queen would wake from her slumber and give birth to a beautiful baby. The light that shone through the queen\'s stomach was the vibrant light given off by Kristine.<br/><br/>Why the sun stone selected Kristine is unknown to anyone. The young princess would spend most of her early years struggling to control the vast power that she was given. At the age of six, Kristine would begin to wander the lost passages and hallways underneath the castle of Marione. Drawn to otherworldly whispers of a man calling to her, Kristine snuck out of her room every night to venture deeper into the tunnel system. The maze of seemingly endless passageways would cause anyone to get lost, but the voice she heard seemed to guide her every time.<br/><br/>This would carry on for over a year until she was eventually caught. She tried to reason with her parents by telling them about the supposed guide and the stories and drawings she had found within the tunnel network. Her parents would begin blocking the child\'s door in an attempt to stop her from sneaking out. Unknown to them, Kristine\'s room had a secret passageway to the tunnel network in it.<br/><br/>Kristine would once again be guided by the voice. After finding her way through the secret entrance, she would uncover the path to her destiny. Her diary records the exact path that she took that night. She went left, right, left, left, right, left, through the third door from the right, under an archway, down a flight of stairs, and finally through the fourth door from the right. While these directions should theoretically allow anyone to find the celestial chamber, I have not found any trace of the secret passageway within Kristine\'s chambers.<br/><br/>The young girl had found the celestial sun stone and with it, she became the Avatar of Sun. When her parents discovered what had happened that night, Kristine would be prohibited from leaving the castle grounds. Kristine would begin honing her newfound spell casting abilities under the watchful eyes of her parents. By the time she was 21, she had become a powerful spell caster and healer.<br/><br/>Rumors began to spread across the kingdoms of the princess\' healing abilities. While nobody suspected the involvement of the sun stone, Kristine\'s remarkable healing abilities caused many to travel to Marione in order to be healed or blessed. She would begin to treat those that came to see her within the castle, but Kristine\'s father kept several guards posted in fear that someone would try to kidnap her for her abilities. A fear that would ultimately be realized.<br/><br/>Kristine would be taken in her sleep and stuffed in a sealed box with a silencing aura. She never saw the face of her captors, but she could tell that shortly after being captured the original kidnappers handed the box to another group. About four days later, Kristine would be awoken by someone opening the box. She quickly used the opportunity to knock out her attacker before fleeing.<br/><br/>Now in a world she has never known, Kristine would quickly get lost within the woods of Obora. She would eventually rest under a great cherry blossom tree and begin praying to the goddess Xanter for aid. After hearing no response, Kristine would begin crying under the tree until her kidnapper, Varion, found her. The two would soon become friends and then eventually lovers. Kristine was able to enjoy the wonders of the world outside the castle walls for the first time in her life, and so she stayed with her former kidnappers.<br/><br/>Varion would teach Kristine how to wield a blade while she would teach him simple magic. She would live on the road for roughly a month with her new companions before eventually heading home after encountering guards from Marione. While she much preferred the world outside the castle walls, she felt she had a duty to her kingdom. Varion and his crew would come with her and eventually live in the castle with her as well. For the first time in as long as she could remember, Kristine had friends.<br/><br/>Kristine would spend the remaining years of her life helping rule Marione while also working on a variety of other projects. During this time she would help her father establish the Coalition of Kingdoms, an alliance between 8 of the 9 kingdoms. Varion would also propose to Kristine when she turned 27. The two would be engaged and were set to marry. Unfortunately for the coalition and Kristine\'s marriage, Demanatus\' invasion would declare war on the 9 kingdoms shortly after.<br/><br/>The Coalition of Kingdoms would fall and soon Kristine with it.

His powers of foresight and time dilation are powerful assets that he largely uses to help his fellow gods make the right decisions.<br/><br/>The god\'s first real direct impact on the world was when he partnered with the elven god of death, Daram. Despite initially disagreeing with Daram\'s plan to allow some races to live longer than others, Kronos eventually saw why doing so may be for the best. He would begin to accelerate the aging of certain beings while slowing it down for others. Elves would become the longest living, while animals and related species would have a much smaller lifespan.<br/><br/>The god would also later aid in the sealing of Pyranus.

After Kronos landed a couple of blows on the tyrant, Demanatus would become reckless and unpredictable with his attacks.

After dropping a large wagon that he was carrying, his master began to beat him. When the boy gave no reaction to the physical wounds dealt to him, his master instead chose to kill the boy\'s now elderly mother. After seeing his mother\'s life fade out of his mother\'s face, the goliath would violently beat up his master until hanging his master\'s body with the whip that had once been used to punish him.<br/><br/>Orion would join the military of Ponem after finding his way into the kingdom roughly 6 years later.

He would become obsessed with finding and killing Varion and his friends. This obsession led to a small decline in the power of the clan, but it still retained formidable power within the world of organized crime.<br/><br/>Demanatus would later use The Leviathan\'s obsession with Varion to his advantage.

While not the most beautiful in her village, her fair complexion and kind nature earned plenty of the male gaze.",' +
			'"entry":"Lilith was born in a small village in the forests of Marione. When she reached the age to get married, she moved towards the plains region to marry a farmer. At the age of 24, she found a husband and settled down on a small farm. Times were hard for Lilith and her husband, but Lilith was just happy to have someone. As a marriage gift, Lilith received a small push dagger that had been in her husband\'s family for a little under a century.<br/><br/>At the age of 28, Lilith gave birth to her son, Varion. The small farm family continued to live a simple life. Lilith would often go to bed hungry, choosing to instead give her share of the food to the young Varion. Two years after giving birth to Varion, tragedy would strike.<br/><br/>The god Pyranus returned to the mortal world and began to terrorize the elven people in hopes of driving out his sister Xanter. When Pyranus arrived at Lilith\'s village, he destroyed it and killed everyone. After killing her husband, Pyranus moved towards a small cave where Lilith and Varion were hiding. Lilith hid her only child in a small outcropping and covered the entrance with a small boulder. Pyranus entered the cave, and after being isolated in the underworld for centuries, decided to enjoy the mortal flesh. He wrapped his hands around Lilith\'s neck and severely burned her. After Pyranus was finished with her, he drew his greatsword to kill the mortal woman.<br/><br/>Lilith did not die that day. As Pyranus raised his greatsword, Lilith remembered her push dagger and drove it into Pyranus\'s eye. Strangely, the blade was able to successfully draw blood from Pyranus. Lilith ran away with Pyranus\' blood still boiling on her knife. As she ran, she prayed to Xanter that her baby would be safe as she broke into tears. Varion would be saved from the cave by an elderly woman who would later turn him into an orphanage in Marione.<br/><br/>After escaping her attacker, Lilith fled to the House of Xanter in Triven. There she prayed for several weeks. After discovering that she was pregnant with Pyranus\' child, she made up her mind to throw herself off the roof of the temple. But as she fell off the roof, she was caught by a beautiful woman, a woman who would later reveal herself as Xanter. Xanter informed Lilith that the dagger she carries was forged by a great blacksmith and was infused with her godly blood. Xanter and Lilith would use this blade to form the legendary sword Xarzith.<br/><br/>After forging Xarzith, Xanter tasked Lilith with traveling to hell to help seal Pyranus. She did so diligently and would meet the goddess Regen in Daedalus\' labyrinth. It would be here that Regen would help Lilith give birth to her second child, whom she named after the labyrinth she was in. Regen agreed to help Lilith on her quest and to help take care of Daedalus. The goddess and Lilith would begin to develop romantic feelings for each other over the course of the next year. But just two years after Lilith gave birth to her second son, the time came to seal Pyranus.<br/><br/>Regen, Xanter, Kronos, and the Stormweaver aided Lilith in sealing the great god of fire. In the end, the seal did not hold, so Lilith sacrificed her soul to help put the final chain on the seal. Now tied to the location where Pyranus was sealed, Lilith tasked Regen to bring Daedalus to the mortal world and try to reunite him with his elder half-brother, assuming Varion was still alive. Regen agreed and brought Daedalus up into the heavens, where he would remain at the age of two until she could find Varion.<br/><br/>Lilith remained at the seal for 23 years before she would come to meet Team Sigma. She died to her own blade, Xarzith, which was now wielded by the paladin Emmet. She gave her life willingly in hopes that Pyranus\' terror could finally be brought to an end.

Birthed in the heat of the sun and manifested by the power of the void stone, Pyranus entered this world and was as big as the planet Jupiter. He took his power and grabbed the debris left over from the Big Bang and compacted it into a planet-sized rock. He set this rock ablaze and then shrunk himself down to fit within its volcanic lands. The rock would be called Elaze and later it would be called Earth.<br/><br/>The burning heat of his new creation would later temper and give life when Pyranus\' sister, Xanter, was created by the celestial sun stone. This angered Pyranus, who never forgave his sister for ruining his creation. As ages passed, Pyranus would begin to torment the life that had grown on this world. When he decided that wasn\'t enough, he created hell to torment these souls for all eternity. However, it was one such soul that arrived in hell that he would soon fall in love with.<br/><br/>Eramis, a shadow deity with a powerful connection to the celestial void stone, would sneak into hell and attempt to steal one of the artifacts Pyranus collected. She was detected, and Pyranus aimed to kill her for her trespasses. However, Eramis was just as clever as she was powerful, and as such, managed to avoid the gods\' grasp. She escaped, but Pyranus, so impressed with the shadow deity\'s skill, would track her down and ask her to live with him.<br/><br/>Eramis would join Pyranus in hell and give birth to two children, Aurora and Daram. Many years after the birth of their children, Eramis had a vision of a child of Xanter who would destroy Pyranus and the other gods. The vision recurred until ultimately a prophecy was made. This angered Pyranus, whose rage and fury led him to abuse his family. Fearing for the safety of her family, Eramis would flee with both children.<br/><br/>After finding Eramis and sealing her away in The Pit, Pyranus would go on to search for Xanter and kill her before she could give birth. At first, he was not as apparent. He chose to send assassins with enchanted blades to kill Xanter. These assassins were not successful. This angered Pyranus further, which led to many rampages, including one where he raped Lilith and conceived a demigod child named Daedalus. His sister would reveal herself as Abigail Ulrich but would then quickly seal Pyranus in the underworld with the help of Lilith.<br/><br/>From his seal, Pyranus learned of Xanter\'s children and quickly hatched a plot to kill them. He possessed the Jungle Chieftain and enacted <span class=godly-code>The Great Purge</span>, where he seemingly killed all of the Ulrich family. Believing himself successful, Pyranus rested in his seal until the time was right. It wasn\'t until he learned that one of the children of Xanter, Demanatus, had lived that he would interfere with mortals. Upon discovery of Demanatus and his mission, Pyranus quickly began to try and break free of his seal. By the time his seal was broken, however, it was too late.<br/><br/>Pyranus was attacked by Team Sigma as well as multiple forces of Demanatus. According to Yharon, Demanatus himself appeared and chained the great god down so that Team Sigma could enact the final blow. Pyranus was slain, and his heart was taken by Raphael who aspired to be the next god of fire. Pyranus\' reign is at its end. The oldest god has been slain, and now a new power must rise.

For two years, the trio and Stallion would terrorize law enforcement across the 9 Kingdoms.<br/><br/>Now, at the age of 22, Varion decided to propose to Stallion. While he did not truly love her, he saw this as a way for him to gain favor with the Leviathan and appease his girlfriend. After the proposal, the Leviathan tasked Varion, Cunter Nickel, and Lance to retrieve a wedding gift from Marione. The trio agreed and went to Marione to pick up a large box. When about halfway to the Leviathan Clan\'s base in Triven, Varion\'s curiosity got the better of him and he opened the box. He found a beautiful woman wearing the garb of the Marione royal family. He quickly ungagged and unbound the woman who used the opportunity to knock out Varion and escape.<br/><br/>When Varion awoke, he and his partners in crime scrambled to find the woman. Varion found her crying underneath a cherry blossom tree. After assuring her that he meant no harm and that he didn\'t know she was in the box they were transporting, the woman allowed Varion to sit and talk to her. She introduced herself as Kristine, and Varion introduced himself as Alexander. The duo sat and talked for hours before Kristine told Varion that she didn\'t want to go home. She asked Varion to run away with her and they could both leave their past lives behind. Varion agreed so long as Cunter Nickel and Lance could come along.<br/><br/>Within a month of being on the road, Varion and Kristine were madly in love. Among his close friends, Varion began going by Alexander again. The group became hired help and would help improve the towns they visited. Two months after their meeting and an encounter with the Marione guard, Kristine would tell her new friends and lover about her status as a princess and would decide to go home. Varion and the gang returned with her. While Marion was not welcoming of the former criminals at first, the princesses\' love for the trio allowed them to gain favor with the kingdom. Varion and Cunter Nickel would both aid the royal guard while Lance would aid the royal chef. When not serving those roles, the trio and Kristine were going to other kingdoms and brokering peace or helping when needed. Daedalus would later join the group as the clumsy inventor.<br/><br/>At the age of 28, and after 6 years of adventures, Varion proposed to Kristine. Kristine agreed, and the couple were to be married. The kingdom celebrated with joy after hearing the announcement, but the celebration was short-lived. A new threat from the Jungle, Demanatus, declared war on the 9 Kingdoms. To protect his daughter and the sun stone that she wielded, King Marione prohibited Kristine from leaving the castle. Varion and Kristine held up in the castle for a long year before Demanatus invaded and killed Kristine and Lance. Varion fled with a now permanently damaged Cunter Nickel.<br/><br/>Varion now serves as an advisor to the resistance. He works closely with Daedalus on his research while also managing Kristine\'s affairs. Upon capture, Demanatus and I interrogated him and tortured him for the location of the sun stone as well as how to access The Collision Point. He held strong despite us removing his hands. The information Varion possesses is too powerful in anyone\'s hands. It is for this reason that Demanatus has now made Varion a high-priority target. The knowledge he retains from his life with Kristine could turn the tide in the war.",' +

			'"entry":"Before our universe first came into existence, there was another one just like ours. Before that universe, another one that was just as vast and diverse. Nothing has remained the same across the infinite number of universes that preceded our own except two constants: the celestial stones of light and dark, life and death, sun and moon.<br/><br/>The void stone has witnessed millions of universes come and go, participating in an endless cycle of creation and destruction. While the sun stone creates life from inorganic matter, the void stone creates and manipulates inorganic matter using the decay of life. Both are equally important to the balance and inner workings of our world. Without void, the universe would create an unsustainable amount of life. Without the sun, the universe would be lifeless and stale.<br/><br/>The entity that embodies the void stone is not a god but a manifestation of part of the universe. The spirit is far more powerful than any god while within its domain, but the spirit cannot directly alter our physical world without an avatar to channel its power. Even then, the chosen avatar still retains their free will while gaining the powers of the void stone.<br/><br/>The void spirit has been known to possess or manipulate those it deems a threat to its role or ambitions. The only people immune to this direct possession or manipulation are the sun and void avatars. Those possessed by the void stone have their minds enter the Realm of Lost Shadows, a place with no color where those slain by the void stone reside. My research indicates that it is possible to break free of such a possession, but it has only been done by The Architect, the original designer of the Celestial Temples and the one who sealed the void stone within the Temple of the Eclipsed Sun.<br/><br/>While the void stone may only possess one creature at a time, it can trap hundreds of people in an unconscious state using dream manipulation. One would likely be able to escape this scenario with energy from the sun stone or by breaking the illusion by making things as they are in reality. The void stone will likely try to interfere, but death is not really an issue in one\'s dreamscape.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the void stone is a rising threat. As Demanatus\' sanity slowly fades due to his wielding and probing of the void stone, the stone gains more and more influence over his actions. I have my suspicions that while Demanatus wishes to wield both the sun and void stones to create a new universe, the void stone wishes to break free of its cyclical role by destroying the sun stone.",' +

Her soft lips and perfect feminine physique have been the envy of men and women alike for centuries. Few have gotten the chance to touch her dress as she eloquently walks or dances. Almost none have gotten the chance to touch the goddess herself.",' +
			'"entry":"Xanter was one of the first gods to emerge in the world. Pyranus was the first god and created the Earth in its original volcanic hellscape state. However, after the celestial Sun Stone gave creation to Xanter, the world began to cool. Xanter\'s powers of ice were quickly melted by the fire and brimstone of Pyranus\' creation, but that melted ice would begin to form a primordial soup. It is here that the world first began to take shape, and new gods and lifeforms were created by the celestial stones.<br/><br/>Long after her part in creating a hospitable planet, Xanter and her brother Pyranus would discover the first civilization, a small tribe of elves. Both beings would be welcomed by the elves, who would later call them gods. Pyranus soon became angered by the elves and their love of life and restoration. He decided that they should be annihilated, and that life should start over. Xanter chose to instead protect the people, further driving a rift between her and her elder brother. At the end of the ensuing conflict, Pyranus drew his greatsword and cut across the land, dividing the civilization into two. The two remaining halves would then go on to form Obora and Lothra, with the great scar left by Pyranus\' actions leaving a great river across the once great plains.<br/><br/>The conflict never sat well with Xanter, causing her to take a more passive role. Many millennia passed, and as the 9 Kingdoms formed, Xanter looked on with pride. She began working with the other gods, both elven and other pantheons, to help bring prosperity across the land. She never took credit for these actions, but Obora recognized her for it. She would occasionally disguise herself and enter the developing kingdoms to explore what the civilizations had to offer. It was on such a visit that she would meet her one and only love.<br/><br/>When visiting a small but powerful kingdom developing in the jungle, she began calling herself Abigail. She made her skin appear tan and dirty and wore peasant clothes. Her blue hair appeared as a brown mess other than a single streak of blue. When going into the town, she met a group of guards who began tormenting her. After being pushed face first into the mud, she would pull herself up and find a sword across her neck. This sword was not just any sword, as she quickly recognized the mark of Pyranus. These were not guards but assassins sent to put an end to her life once and for all. She closed her eyes and braced herself for the enchanted blade to end her immortal life. But the blade instead dropped to the ground.<br/><br/>She opened her eyes to see a handsome warrior with short blonde hair standing over the bloody mess of her would-be killer. The warrior introduced himself as Yharim Ulrich, and five years later, Xanter would take his last name when she married him. To her husband and later her kids, Xanter would reveal her true form. To the rest of the world, she became Abigail Ulrich.<br/><br/>Nine years after her marriage to Yharim, she and her husband discovered the Temple of the Eclipsed Sun. They ventured inside to discover that Xanter\'s magic and immortality were greatly weakened within the temple walls. After further inspection and many close calls, they discovered the celestial void stone that had come to rest at the heart of the temple. Entrapped in tendrils, the void stone would remain in that temple, but its secrets would be revealed to Yharim. The couple would leave the temple with only a small fossilized dragon egg, but would return hundreds of times over the next decade. In the excitement of their discovery, the two would conceive their first child, Elros.<br/><br/>A year passed, and Yharim would become King of the Jungle. Elros was a welcome surprise in their life as Xanter thought herself unable to have children, much less with a mortal. A year later another son would be born, Demanatus. Four years after that, their final child and only daughter, Artemis, would be born. The couple raised their kids in a warm and loving home. All three children would become skilled warriors. The sons and their father would train to wield celestial void magic while Artemis would learn healing from Xanter. It was a great and happy family, until Pyranus and his children returned to the mortal world to enact terror.<br/><br/>Unbeknownst to Xanter, Eramis, Pyranus\'s wife, had prophesied 155 years prior that the son of Xanter who was born from true love would be the downfall of the gods. This was the reason for Pyranus\' long-held anger told his sister and the reason that Xanter\'s life as Abigail Ulrich would come to an end. After sealing Pyranus with the aid of Lilith and other gods, Xanter and her family would be faced with a war against Pyranus\' children.<br/><br/>After a successful war and the sealing of Daram, Xanter and her family would return to their jungle home as heroes. After being forced to reveal her true identity during the events of the war, Xanter was uneasy about returning home. She would be welcomed back with a great feast and celebration. Unfortunately, her family would be deceived and be sentenced to death in <span class=pyranus-code>The Great Purge</span>. She would lose her husband of 32 years to this event as well as seemingly all of her children.<br/><br/>After losing her family to a great volcano, Xanter would ascend into the heavens, two of her tears would fall as she left. These tears would become powerful artifacts that would one day be used in the reforging of the weapon Xarzith. Xanter stayed in the heavens for many years. Few interacted with the grieving wife and mother. Her isolation lasted for 18 long years before a single prayer, that of her once-thought-dead daughter, would stir her back into the troubles of mortals.<br/><br/>Xanter would return to the mortal world and discover the truth of what happened during The Great Purge. She now opposes her favorite and middle child, Demanatus. It is unlikely that Xanter would ever harm any of her children,<br/><br/>especially Demanatus, regardless of their actions. Demanatus, however, has built up 18 years of resentment for his mother. If Demanatus has the chance, Xanter will meet the same fiery end that her husband did.",' +

The dragon\'s fierce horns are 8 ft. long and protrude backward past the dragon\'s fierce face. When Yharon\'s eyes are burning like a fierce fire, her soft and caring eyes cut through the beast\'s otherwise terrifying appearance.",' +
			'"entry":"Before Yharon and before the rise of the great Jungle Kingdom, the fierce dragons of the jungle were perhaps the most lethal creatures on our planet. Their breath was rumored to be hotter than the fires of the underworld and capable of incinerating even the most durable of materials. It was long believed that these creatures were immortal gods that rivaled Pyranus himself. While their origin has never been fully discovered, archives from the Temple of the Eclipsed Sun and my biological research on Yharon have led me to conclude that these beings were born from the heat of our universe\'s creation. This suggests that the species may be the oldest living species, even surpassing Pyranus in age.<br/><br/>The unkillable nature of the jungle dragons led many to seek them out and attempt to slay the beasts in order to gain a reputation beyond no other. It wasn\'t until fighting these beasts that many would come to understand the true meaning of power and the reason why these creatures have such a strong undercoat of feathers. While few would succeed in slaying one of the beasts, the few that did would go on to found the mighty Jungle Tribe. The already small quantity of jungle dragons would begin dwindling before becoming outright extinct. The last known jungle dragon would be hunted down and killed by Yharim at the age of 18. It wasn\'t until almost 20 years later that the true last dragon would be found.<br/><br/>Xanter and Yharim found the last jungle dragon egg in the great tree at the Temple of the Eclipsed Sun. Xanter would convince her husband to bring the egg home as a reminder of the sins of the Jungle Kingdom and Yharim\'s past. Yharim agreed, and Xanter would spend the next several years trying to figure out how to hatch the egg. With no luck, she would eventually give the egg to her middle child, Demanatus. Demanatus often carried the egg and did so even when he was thrown into the fires of a volcano during <span class=demanatus-code>The Great Purge</span>. The extreme heat of the volcano allowed the egg to hatch, and the great Yharon was born.<br/><br/>The great dragon would flee the jungle with Demanatus and Elros in its claws. Demanatus would spend the next couple of years of his life on the run while bonding with Yharon. Demanatus would later discover that the jungle dragons are empaths capable of feeling and even taking away emotions of those around them. The two would gain an unbreakable bond. The young Yharon gave Demanatus the love and support that he so desperately craved.<br/><br/>Years of comforting Demanatus and feeling the rage and pain led to these feelings beginning to manifest inside of Yharon. Due to her personality conflicting with such extreme feelings of rage, Yharon would begin to manifest a split male personality to deal with these emotions. When Demanatus began his great conquest, Yharon would use this male personality to bring destruction and chaos to those areas that his master saw fit.<br/><br/>Shortly after I joined the ranks of Demanatus\' army, I was tasked with a project to clone the great beast. My experiments eventually led to the creation of the RGR-YHAR-DGR specimens. Yharon would take these specimens and raise them in Marione, where she now resides. Despite being clones, Yharon treats the young dragons as if they were her own kids. Her mood has substantially increased since then. Demanatus has been very pleased with this and is happy that Yharon gets the chance to be a mother.<br/><br/>Yharon is most certainly the largest threat within Demanatus\' army. Not only because of the sheer power of the beast, but also because of the horrors that Demanatus would commit if something were to happen to them. That being said, Yharon\'s power and location in Marione mean that the creature will likely remain untouched for the rest of its lifespan. Should someone try to kill the beast, they will likely be outmatched once they discover the real reason these dragons were so hard to kill.",' +
