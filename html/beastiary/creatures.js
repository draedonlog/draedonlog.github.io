In general, she wears her battle hardened Oboran armor over her Jungle under armor. Though she prefers the warrior look now, in her youth she would often wear traditional Jungle dresses that would showcase her feminine features.",' +
			'"entry":"Artemis was born the third child and only daughter of Xanter and Yharim. From an early age, Artemis would often practice swordplay with her brothers Elros and Demanatus. When she was not with her brothers, she was with her mother, Xanter, learning how to heal and act like a princess. When she was 15 years old she went with the rest of her family to serve in the war against Aurora and Daram. Her healing abilities allowed her to serve as a medic to the Jungle warriors. She was entrusted in particular to help her brothers and father recover from using void magic. While her healing was useless to heal such wounds, her soft touch and tender care resulted in quick recovery periods for her family.<br><br>After her father, Yharim, successfully sealed Daram in Barindale, Artemis and her family would briefly return home to the Jungle. Despite Yharim giving up his title as Jungle Chief, the family was treated like royalty. Artemis enjoyed the quiet of home life and became fast friends with a young demigod named Rainey who was visiting the Jungle. A month after sealing Daram and after two years of fighting the war, Aurora surrendered herself to the Jungle tribe.<br><br>To celebrate the end of the war, the Jungle Chief held a small tournament and celebration. The greatest heroes of the war were invited to compete in order to earn a spot within the mighty Jungle Guard. However, it was revealed at the preliminary dinner that the celebration was a ruse. The following event,<em>The Great Purge</em> lasted only a day but left hundreds of the fiercest warriors slain in the most gruesome way. Since Artemis was female, Aurora offered her a deal to join the Valkyries and be spared. Artemis accepted in hopes to use her freedom to save her family. She watched as her father and brothers were thrown into the lava of Mount Pyranus. While her father\’s body and soul would melt in this volcano, Elros and Demanatus seemingly escaped in the talons of a baby dragon.<br><br>Artemis would serve Aurora and the Valkyries for the next 19 years. She made friends with many of her fellow Valkyries but always held resentment for Aurora. Despite this, her skill with magic and a blade allowed her to rise quickly in the ranks. She would become the second in command after 15 years. After 19 years, she was given a task by Aurora to infiltrate the guard of Obora and give any intel she retrieved to her. Artemis would later find out that this task was given by her brother Demanatus, who has ascended the throne and enslaved Aurora. She served this post for 3 years, eventually rising to the rank of Oboran general during the Siege of Obora. However, when Aurora was slain by the resistance in the second Siege of Obora, Artemis chose to be loyal to Obora rather than Demanatus\’ forces.<br><br>Artemis now leads the resistance against her older brother. Her skill in combat and strategy has allowed the resistance to gain more territory than expected over the past couple of months. She also directly oversees Team Sigma\’s operations within the resistance. Additionally, after reconnecting with her childhood friend Rainey, she began to lighten up a bit more. Things seem to be looking up for Artemis, something that Demanatus is planning on changing soon.",' +

			'"entry":"Aurora was born to Eramis and Pyranus before time was first recorded. Pyranus raised Aurora and her brother Daram with fear and constant punishment. Centuries of abuse and torture later, Aurora would flee with her brother and mother into the mortal world. It was here that Eramis would teach Aurora how to read and write as well as the importance of strategy and careful planning. Eramis attempted to raise both her children to be generous and kind, two traits that neither would come to possess. After Pyranus found his family again, he banished Eramis to <em>The Pit</em> and returned Aurora and Daram to the underworld.<br><br>After centuries passed, Pyranus would send his children out into the world to find their own way and to wreak havoc across the world. Aurora would become the Elven Goddess of War. She would often support Elven aggression and charge the battlefield with those she deemed fit. As centuries more passed, Aurora began to feel lonely as many of her mortal warriors died on the battlefield or from old age. She would go on to convince her brother, the Elven God of Death, to make the mightiest of her female warriors immune to death. With this, the Valkyries were formed.<br><br>With new companions and a group of supporters, Aurora would continue to serve as the Elven Goddess of War. After finding out that her father had been sealed away, she convinced her brother to join her in attempting to take over the 9 kingdoms. The war would go on for two years and would result in the destruction of countless lives. The war ended when a mighty Jungle general named Yharim sealed Daram with a legendary weapon. However, Aurora would get revenge for this action when she convinced her father to possess the Jungle Chief and initiate <em>The Great Purge</em>.<br><br>Aurora would go into hiding for many years after that and search for her brother. 19 years after <em>The Great Purge</em>, Demanatus would find Aurora and beat her to an inch of her life. With Aurora in chains, he would install void explosives along her spine. These were inserted while Aurora could feel every cut and action. After having the explosives installed, Demanatus would demand that Aurora serve him or he would detonate the charges causing her and her soul to be lost to the void stone. She and her Valkyries would then serve Demanatus for three years.<br><br>After three long years and being tasked with holding the kingdom of Obora, Aurora would use her new gained standing to learn the location of her brother. When attempting to manipulate Team Sigma into freeing her brother, the team instead restored the seal while retrieving the legendary weapon that once sealed him there. This weapon would later weaken Aurora at the Second Siege of Obora before she was ultimately killed by Demanatus.",' +
