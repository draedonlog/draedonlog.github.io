Though she prefers the warrior look now, in her youth she would often wear traditional Jungle dresses that would showcase her feminine features.",' +
			'"entry":"Artemis was born the third child and only daughter of Xanter and Yharim. From an early age, Artemis would often practice swordplay with her brothers Elros and Demanatus. When she was not with her brothers, she was with her mother, Xanter, learning how to heal and act like a princess. When she was 15 years old she went with the rest of her family to serve in the war against Aurora and Daram. Her healing abilities allowed her to serve as a medic to the Jungle warriors. She was entrusted in particular to help her brothers and father recover from using void magic. While her healing was useless to heal such wounds, her soft touch and tender care resulted in quick recovery periods for her family.<br><br>After her father, Yharim, successfully sealed Daram in Barindale, Artemis and her family would briefly return home to the Jungle. Despite Yharim giving up his title as Jungle Chief, the family was treated like royalty. Artemis enjoyed the quiet of home life and became fast friends with a young demigod named Rainey who was visiting the Jungle. A month after sealing Daram and after two years of fighting the war, Aurora surrendered herself to the Jungle tribe.<br><br>To celebrate the end of the war, the Jungle Chief held a small tournament and celebration. The greatest heroes of the war were invited to compete in order to earn a spot within the mighty Jungle Guard. However, it was revealed at the preliminary dinner that the celebration was a ruse. The following event,<em>The Great Purge</em> lasted only a day but left hundreds of the fiercest warriors slain in the most gruesome way. Since Artemis was female, Aurora offered her a deal to join the Valkyries and be spared. Artemis accepted in hopes to use her freedom to save her family. She watched as her father and brothers were thrown into the lava of Mount Pyranus. While her father\’s body and soul would melt in this volcano, Elros and Demanatus seemingly escaped in the talons of a baby dragon.<br><br>Artemis would serve Aurora and the Valkyries for the next 19 years. She made friends with many of her fellow Valkyries but always held resentment for Aurora. Despite this, her skill with magic and a blade allowed her to rise quickly in the ranks. She would become the second in command after 15 years. After 19 years, she was given a task by Aurora to infiltrate the guard of Obora and give any intel she retrieved to her. Artemis would later find out that this task was given by her brother Demanatus, who has ascended the throne and enslaved Aurora. She served this post for 3 years, eventually rising to the rank of Oboran general during the Siege of Obora. However, when Aurora was slain by the resistance in the second Siege of Obora, Artemis chose to be loyal to Obora rather than Demanatus\’ forces.<br><br>Artemis now leads the resistance against her older brother. Her skill in combat and strategy has allowed the resistance to gain more territory than expected over the past couple of months. She also directly oversees Team Sigma\’s operations within the resistance. Additionally, after reconnecting with her childhood friend Rainey, she began to lighten up a bit more. Things seem to be looking up for Artemis, something that Demanatus is planning on changing soon.",' +

			'"entry":"Aurora was born to Eramis and Pyranus before time was first recorded. Pyranus raised Aurora and her brother Daram with fear and constant punishment. Centuries of abuse and torture later, Aurora would flee with her brother and mother into the mortal world. It was here that Eramis would teach Aurora how to read and write as well as the importance of strategy and careful planning. Eramis attempted to raise both her children to be generous and kind, two traits that neither would come to possess. After Pyranus found his family again, he banished Eramis to <em>The Pit</em> and returned Aurora and Daram to the underworld.<br><br>After centuries passed, Pyranus would send his children out into the world to find their own way and to wreak havoc across the world. Aurora would become the Elven Goddess of War. She would often support Elven aggression and charge the battlefield with those she deemed fit. As centuries more passed, Aurora began to feel lonely as many of her mortal warriors died on the battlefield or from old age. She would go on to convince her brother, the Elven God of Death, to make the mightiest of her female warriors immune to death. With this, the Valkyries were formed.<br><br>With new companions and a group of supporters, Aurora would continue to serve as the Elven Goddess of War. After finding out that her father had been sealed away, she convinced her brother to join her in attempting to take over the 9 kingdoms. The war would go on for two years and would result in the destruction of countless lives. The war ended when a mighty Jungle general named Yharim sealed Daram with a legendary weapon. However, Aurora would get revenge for this action when she convinced her father to possess the Jungle Chief and initiate <em>The Great Purge</em>.<br><br>Aurora would go into hiding for many years after that and search for her brother. 19 years after <em>The Great Purge</em>, Demanatus would find Aurora and beat her to an inch of her life. With Aurora in chains, he would install void explosives along her spine. These were inserted while Aurora could feel every cut and action. After having the explosives installed, Demanatus would demand that Aurora serve him or he would detonate the charges causing her and her soul to be lost to the void stone. She and her Valkyries would then serve Demanatus for three years.<br><br>After three long years and being tasked with holding the kingdom of Obora, Aurora would use her new gained standing to learn the location of her brother. When attempting to manipulate Team Sigma into freeing her brother, the team instead restored the seal while retrieving the legendary weapon that once sealed him there. This weapon would later weaken Aurora at the Second Siege of Obora before she was ultimately killed by Demanatus.",' +

When Pyranus arrived at Lilith\’s village he destroyed it and killed everyone. After killing her husband, Pyranus would move towards a small cave where Lilith and Varion were hiding. Lilith would hide her only child in a small outcropping and cover the entrance with a small boulder. Pyranus entered the cave and after being isolated in the underworld for centuries, decided to enjoy the mortal flesh. He wrapped his hands around Lilith\’s neck and severely burned her. After Pyranus was finished with her, he drew his greatsword to kill the mortal woman.<br><br>Lilith did not die that day. As Pyranus drew his greatsword, Lilith remembered her push dagger and drove it into Pyranus\’ eye. Strangely, the blade was able to successfully draw blood from Pyranus. Lilith ran away with Pyranus\’ blood still boiling on her knife. As she ran she prayed to Xanter that her baby would be safe as she broke into tears. Varion would be saved from the cave by an elderly woman who would later turn him into an orphanage in Marione.<br><br>After escaping her attacker, Lilith would flee to the <em>House of Xanter</em> in Triven. There she would pray for several weeks. After discovering that she was pregnant with Pyranus\’ child, she made up her mind to throw herself off the roof of the temple. But as she fell off the roof, she was caught by a beautiful woman, a woman who would later reveal herself as Xanter. Xanter informed Lilith that the dagger she carries was forged by a great blacksmith and was infused with her godly blood. Xanter and Lilith would use this blade to form the legendary sword Xarzith.<br><br>After forging Xarzith, Xanter would task Lilith with traveling to hell in order to help seal Pyranus. She did so diligently and would meet the goddess Regen in Daedalus\’ labyrinth. It would be here that Regen would help Lilith give birth to her second child who she named after the labyrinth she was in. Regen agreed to help Lilith on her quest and to help take care of Daedalus. The goddess and Lilith would begin to develop romantic feelings for each other over the course of the next year. But just two years after Lilith gave birth to her second son, the time came to seal Pyranus.<br><br>Regen, Xanter, Kronos, and the Stormweaver would aid Lilith in sealing the great god of fire. In the end the seal would not hold, so Lilith sacrificed her soul to help put the final chain on the seal. Now tied to the location where Pyranus was sealed, Lilith tasked Regen to bring Daedalus to the mortal world and try to reunite him with his elder half brother, assuming Varion was still alive. Regen agreed, and brought Daedalus up into the heavens where he would remain at the age of two until she could find Varion.<br><br>Lilith remained at the seal for 23 years before she would come to meet Team Sigma. She would die to her own blade, Xarzith, which was now wielded by the paladin Emmet. She gave her life willingly in hopes that Pyranus\’ terror could finally be brought to an end.

			'"entry":"When the big bang first occurred and the celestial stones created the universe as we know it, the world was empty other than a few celestial bodies. Birthed in the heat of the sun and manifested by the power of the void stone, Pyranus entered this world and was as big as the planet Jupiter. He took his power and grabbed the debris left over from the big bang and compacted it into a planet size rock. He set this rock ablaze and then shrunk himself down to fit within its volcanic lands. The rock would be called <em>Elaze</em> and later it would be called <em>Earth</em>.<br><br>The burning heat of his new creation would later temper and give life when Pyranus\’ sister, Xanter, was created by the celestial sun stone. This angered Pyranus, who never forgave his sister for ruining his creation. As ages passed, Pyranus would begin to torment the life that had grown on this world. When he decided that wasn\’t enough, he created hell to torment these souls for all eternity. However, it was one such soul that arrived in hell that he would soon fall in love with.<br><br>Eramis, a shadow deity with a powerful connection to the celestial void stone, would sneak into hell and attempt to steal one of the artifacts Pyranus collected. She was detected and Pyranus aimed to kill her for her trespasses. However, Eramis was clever and powerful and as such managed to avoid the gods\' grasp. She escaped, but Pyranus, so impressed with the shadow deity\'s skill, would track her down and ask her to live with him.<br><br>Eramis would join Pyranus in hell and give birth to two children, Aurora and Daram. Many years after the birth of their children, Eramis had a vision of a child of Xanter who would destroy Pyranus and the other gods. The vision recurred until ultimately a prophecy was made. This angered Pyranus, whose rage and fury led him to abuse his family. Fearing for the safety of her family, Eramis would flee with both children.<br><br>After finding Eramis and sealing her away in <em>The Pit</em>, Pyranus would go on to search for Xanter and kill her before she could give birth. At first he was not as apparent. He chose to send assassins with enchanted blades to kill Xanter. These assassins were not successful. This angered Pyranus further, which led to many rampages, including one where he raped Lilith and conceived a demigod child named Daedalus. His sister would reveal herself as Abigail Ulrich, but would then quickly seal Pyranus in the underworld with the help of Lilith.<br><br>From his seal Pyranus learned of Xanter\’s children and quickly hatched a plot to kill them. He possessed the Jungle Chieftain and enacted <em>The Great Purge</em>, where he seemingly killed all of the Ulrich family. Believing himself successful, Pyranus rested in his seal until the time was right. It wasn\’t until he learned that one of the children of Xanter, Demanatus, had lived that he would interfere with mortals. Upon discovery of Demanatus and his mission, Pyranus quickly began to try and break free of his seal. By the time his seal was broken however, it was too late.<br><br>Pyranus was attacked by Team Sigma as well as multiple forces of Demanatus. According to Yharon, Demanatus himself appeared and chained the great god down so that Team Sigma could enact the final blow.

When his village was destroyed by Pyranus, his mother successfully hid him in a cave while Pyranus had his way with her. A day later, an elderly woman would find the baby crying in a small cave and take him to an orphanage just outside the main city of Marione.<br><br>Alexander grew up in the orphanage where he would meet his best friend, Lance. The two were constantly getting into trouble both with the orphanage and with Marione law. Alexander dreamed of a life of adventure and would practice fighting with wooden swords in the orphanage\’s walls. When they were 16, Alexander and Lance would run away from the orphanage to find their calling. It was then that Alexander would start going by Varion.<br><br>After four years on the road, Varion and Lance had worked up a reputation as <em>The Silent Strikers</em>. The duo pickpocketed from just about anybody and were known for being able to wipe out a store before the owner knew what happened. While attempting to steal the jewel of Sunem, Varion and Lance would be arrested and thrown in jail. In that cell, they would meet a warforged barbarian named Cunter Nickel. The trio would soon escape and join <em>The Leviathan Clan</em>. After some good scores and with a little bit of charisma, Varion began dating the leader of the clan\’s daughter, Stallion. For two years the trio and Stallion would terrorize law enforcement across the 9 Kingdoms.<br><br>Now, at the age of 22, Varion decided to propose to Stallion. While he did not truly love her, he saw this as a way for him to gain favor with the Leviathan and appease his girlfriend. After the proposal, the Leviathan tasked Varion, Cunter Nickel, and Lance to retrieve a wedding gift from Marione. The trio agreed and went to Marione to pick up a large box. When about halfway to the Leviathan Clan\’s base in Triven, Varion\’s curiosity got the better of him and he opened the box. He found a beautiful woman wearing the garb of the Marione royal family. He quickly ungagged and unbound the woman who used the opportunity to knock out Varion and escape.<br><br>When Varion awoke, he and his partners in crime scrambled to find the woman. Varion found her crying underneath a cherry blossom tree. After ensuring her that he meant no harm and that he didn\’t know she was in the box they were transporting, the woman allowed Varion to sit and talk to her. She introduced herself as Kristine, and Varion introduced himself as Alexander. The duo sat and talked for hours before Kristine told Varion that she didn\’t want to go home. She asked Varion to run away with her and they could both leave their past lives behind. Varion agreed so long as Cunter Nickel and Lance could come along.<br><br>Within a month of being on the road Varion and Kristine were madly in love. Among his close friends, Varion began going by Alexander again. The group became hired help and would help improve the towns they visited. Two months after their meeting and an encounter with the Marione guard, Kristine would decide to come home. Varion and the gang returned with her. While Marion was not welcoming of the former criminals at first, the princesses love for the trio allowed them to gain favor with the kingdom. Varion and Cunter Nickel would both aid the royal guard while Lance would aid the royal chef. When not serving those roles, the trio and Kristine were going to other kingdoms and brokering peace or helping when needed. Daedalus would later join the group as the clumsy inventor.<br><br>At the age of 28, and after 6 years of adventures, Varion proposed to Kristine. Kristine agreed, and the couple were to be married. The kingdom celebrated with joy after hearing the announcement, but the celebration was short lived. A new threat from the Jungle, Demanatus, declared war on the 9 Kingdoms. To protect his daughter and the sun stone that she wielded; King Marione prohibited Kristine from leaving the castle. Varion and Kristine held up in the castle for a long year before Demanatus invaded and killed Kristine and Lance. Varion fled with a now permanently damaged Cunter Nickel.<br><br>Varion now serves as an advisor to the resistance. He works closely with Daedalus on his research while also managing Kristine\’s affairs. Upon capture, Demanatus and I interrogated him and tortured him for the location of the sun stone as well as how to access <em>The Collision Point</em>. He held strong despite us removing his hands.

However, after the celestial Sun Stone gave creation to Xanter the world began to cool. Xanter\’s powers of ice were quickly melted by the fire and brimstone of Pyranus\’ creation, but that melted ice would begin to form a primordial soup. It is here that the world first began to take shape and new gods and lifeforms were created by the celestial stones.<br><br>Long after her part in creating a hospitable planet, Xanter and her brother Pyranus would discover the first civilization, a small tribe of elves. Both beings would be welcomed by the elves who would later call them gods. Pyranus soon became angered by the elves and their love of life and restoration. He decided that they should be annihilated and that life should start over. Xanter chose to instead protect the people, further driving a rift between her and her elder brother. At the end of the ensuing conflict, Pyranus drew his greatsword and cut across the land dividing the civilization into two. The two remaining halves would then go on to form Obora and Lothra, with the great scar left by Pyranus\’ actions leaving a great river across the once great plain.<br><br>The conflict never sat well with Xanter, causing her to take a more passive role. Many millennia passed and as the 9 Kingdoms formed Xanter looked on with pride. She began working with the other gods, both elven and other pantheons, to help bring prosperity across the land. She never took credit for these actions, but Obora recognized her for it. She would occasionally disguise herself and enter the developing kingdoms to explore what the civilizations had to offer. It was on such a visit that she would meet her one and only love.<br><br>When visiting a small but powerful kingdom developing in the jungle she began calling herself Abigail. She made her skin appear tan and dirty and wore peasant clothes. Her blue hair appeared as a brown mess other than a single streak of blue. When going into the town she met a group of guards who began tormenting her. After being pushed face first into mud she would pull herself up and find a sword across her neck. This sword was not just any sword as she quickly recognized the mark of Pyranus. These were not guards, but assassins sent to put an end to her life once and for all. She closed her eyes and braced herself for the enchanted blade to end her immortal life. But the blade instead dropped to the ground.<br><br>She opened her eyes to see a handsome warrior with short blonde hair standing over the bloody mess of her would be killer. The warrior introduced himself as Yharim Ulrich, and five years later Xanter would take his last name when she married him. To her husband and later her kids, Xanter would reveal her true form. To the rest of the world, she became Abigail Ulrich.<br><br>Nine years after her marriage to Yharim, her and her husband discovered the temple of the <em>Eclipsed Sun</em>. They ventured inside to discover that Xanter\’s magic and immortality were greatly weakened within the temple walls. After further inspection and many close calls, they discovered the celestial void stone that had come to rest at the heart of the temple. Entrapped in tendrils, the void stone would remain in that temple, but its secrets would be revealed to Yharim. The couple would leave the temple with only a small fossilized dragon egg, but would return hundreds of times over the next decade. In the excitement of their discovery, the two would conceive their first child, Elros.<br><br>A year passed and Yharim would become King of the Jungle. Elros was a welcome surprise in their life as Xanter thought herself unable to have children, much less with a mortal. A year later another son would be born, Demanatus. Four years after that, their final child and only daughter, Artemis, would be born. The couple raised their kids in a warm and loving home. All three children would become skilled warriors. The sons and their father would train to wield celestial void magic while Artemis would learn healing from Xanter. It was a great and happy family, until Pyranus returned to the mortal world to enact terror.<br><br>Unbeknownst to Xanter, Eramis, Pyranus\’ wife, had prophesied 155 years prior that the son of Xanter who was born from true love would be the downfall of the gods. This was the reason for Pyranus\’ long held anger told his sister and the reason that Xanter\’s life as Abigail Ulrich would come to an end. After many wars and battles Xanter and her family would be sentenced to death in <em>The Great Purge</em>. She would lose her husband of 32 years to this event as well as seemingly all of her children.<br><br>After losing her family to a great volcano Xanter would ascend into the heavens, two of her tears would fall as she left. These tears would become powerful artifacts that would one day be used in the reforging of the weapon Xarzith. Xanter stayed in the heavens for many years. Few interacted with the grieving wife and mother. Her isolation lasted for 18 long years before a single prayer, that of her once thought dead daughter, would stir her back into the troubles of mortals.<br><br>Xanter would return to the mortal world and discover the truth of what happened during <em>The Great Purge</em>. She now opposes her favorite and middle child, Demanatus. It is unlikely that Xanter would ever harm any of her children, especially Demanatus, regardless of their actions. Demanatus, however, has built up 18 years of resentment for his mother. If Demanatus has the chance, Xanter will meet the same fiery end that her husband did.",' +
